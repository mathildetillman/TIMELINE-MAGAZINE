          (1819 - 1900) was an English art critic. His writings were greatly
          sought after by art enthusiasts all over England.

          perception of the world, attributing value to paintings based on their
          central themes, intellectual propensity, and cultural importance.
          Anchored in the past, he was a dreamer who regarded art as a priority,
          high above the running machinery of industrialization which alienated
          the mind and soul from the beauty of the world.

          was a leading force of the British Aesthetic movement. Their

          painted a series of nocturnes of moonlit river scenes during the
          1870s. Nocturne in Black and Gold depicts a roaring cascade of sparks
          falling over the melancholic night sky. Bold, elusive, and enigmatic,
          the painting is anything but shy. It screams with joy and passion!

          was inspired to paint this artwork by the celebrated Cremorne Gardens
          near the River Thames. He used a restrictive palette of muted tones of
          blues, greens, and yellows. His brushstrokes are loose, rendering the
          contrast between light and shadow with playfulness. In the lower half
          of the painting, the figures watching the fireworks are ghost-like
          blotches of paint spread across the canvas. Through sparks of fire,
          the smoke persists in the misty air.
