          After paying a visit to the newly inaugurated Grosvenor Gallery in
          London, John Ruskin wrote a stinging review of the modernist
          exhibition. The review concerned none other than the American painter
          <span
            class="mention person"

            data-label="James McNeill Whistler"
            >James McNeill Whistler</span
          >, who sued the esteemed art critic for libel. Maybe one of the most
          famous (and diverting) lawsuits in art history, it stirred a fruitful
          debate on the importance of art in society. The notorious trial
          exposed into the public eye the very beginnings of modern art as we
          know it today.

        <p>
          John Ruskin (1819 - 1900) was an English art critic. His writings were
          greatly sought after by art enthusiasts all over England. Ruskin was
          also an academic and, contrary to popular belief, an adept of modern
          art. As we will later discover, his love for the arts ran deep into
          his perception of the world, attributing value to paintings based on
          their central themes, intellectual propensity, and cultural
          importance. Anchored in the past, he was a dreamer who regarded art as
          a priority, high above the running machinery of industrialization
          which alienated the mind and soul from the beauty of the world. Ruskin
          was essentially a Victorian Sage, or Prophet, whose work aimed to
          bring social and cultural change.

          >
          (1835 - 1904) was a visionary and one of the earliest proponents of
          modern art, who found his inspiration in subjects of everyday life. By
          associating painting with music,
          <span

          >
          titled many of his paintings as 'arrangements', 'harmonies', and
          'symphonies'. One of his most famous works, Arrangement in Grey and
          Black No. 1 (1871), also known as

          soaking greys of puritanism. Unsurprisingly,

          was a leading force of the British Aesthetic movement. Their
          philosophy was to create 'art for art's sake', substituting aesthetic
          beauty for moralistic, allegorical, or sentimentalist considerations.
          At a time when his contemporaries were still dabbling in the nuances
          of Realism and Impressionism,

          was crafting his distinctive style, closely related to an early
          version of Post-Impressionism.

        <h2>The Exhibition</h2>
        <p>
          In 1877, the newly inaugurated Grosvenor Gallery in London held an
          exhibition of modern artworks rejected by the Royal Academy of Art. It
          included works by John Everett Millais (1829 - 1896) and Edward
          Burne-Jones (1833 - 1898), a Pre-Raphaelite painter and one of
          Ruskin's favorites. In contrast, priced at 200 guineas,
          <span

            Whistler</span
          >'s Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (1875) came as a
          shock to the sentimentalist critic.
        </p>

          >
          painted a series of nocturnes of moonlit river scenes during the
          1870s. Nocturne in Black and Gold depicts a roaring cascade of sparks
          falling over the melancholic night sky. Bold, elusive, and enigmatic,
          the painting is anything but shy. It screams with joy and passion!
          <span

          was inspired to paint this artwork by the celebrated Cremorne Gardens
          near the River Thames. He used a restrictive palette of muted tones of
          blues, greens, and yellows. His brushstrokes are loose, rendering the
          contrast between light and shadow with playfulness. In the lower half
          of the painting, the figures watching the fireworks are ghost-like
          blotches of paint spread across the canvas. Through sparks of fire,
          the smoke persists in the misty air.

          Ruskin published his review of the exhibition in Fors Clavigera No.
          79; a monthly publication written for the 'workers and laborers of
          Great Britain'. Displeased with

          Coutts Lindsay ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in
          which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the
          aspect of wilful imposture. I have seen, and heard, much of Cockney
          impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two
          hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face.

          sued the art critic for libel. Because Ruskin was physically and
          mentally unfit to participate in the trial, he asked Burne-Jones to
          testify on his behalf. At the trial,

          argued that the review had damaged his reputation and generated bad
          publicity for his artworks. In an attempt to justify his defamation
          claims,

          also raised doubt about Ruskin's capacities as an art critic, who was
          not a painter himself. On the other hand, the defense counsel employed
          a two-part strategy by dismissing

            data-label="James McNeill Whistler"

          (1775 - 1851) and his wild, abstracted depictions of nature, often
          found in gestural brushstrokes capturing mere studies of light and
          shade. No, it seems 'unfinished' meant something else to Ruskin; to
          him, the word was far more subtle than what had surfaced during the
          trial. David Craven argues in Ruskin vs.

          was part of the Aesthetic movement. For him, art was a purely visual
          form of expression that should be recognized as such and nothing more.
          He was striving to distance himself from the very intellectual
          associations Ruskin favored in painting.

          painted his nocturnes in the studio, applying a special 'sauce' in
          thin layers, which essentially was a mix of paint with copal,
          turpentine, and linseed oil. At the trial, the judge genuinely asked
          the artist which part of the painting was the bridge in question.

          Despite all appearances, Ruskin wasn't concerned with how long it took

          to perfect his nocturnes. Previously, he wrote that great artworks can
          be done effortlessly, without much struggle. Giving birth to many
          ambiguities and inconsistencies, his absence in the courtroom was
          surely felt.
        </p>

        <h2>Aftermath</h2>

        <p>
          The trial lasted only two days, and it was a lose-lose situation for
          those involved. Even though
          <span
            class="mention person"
            about="JamesMcNeillWhistler"

          had claimed damages of 1,000 pounds in addition to his court costs, he
          was awarded only a farthing, or one-thousandth of a pound. His
          notorious nocturnes were rendered unsalable by the court. By the end
          of the trial,
          <span

          was bankrupt and moved to Venice to work. Things weren't far more
          glamorous for Ruskin himself. He was morally defeated: his reputation
          suffered a great shock, and that same year, he resigned from his Slade
          Professorship of Fine Arts at Oxford University. According to him, his
          right to express a critical opinion about art was denied by British
          Law.

          Ruskin wrote My Own, an article on
          <span
            class="mention person"
            about="JamesMcNeillWhistler"
            data-label="James McNeill Whistler"
            >Whistler</span
          >, shortly after the trial. He returned to the moral virtues in art,
          emphasizing that the value of a great painting is fundamentally tied
          to its conceptual background. Some may argue Ruskin was a socialist.
          He rejected the commercialization of society encouraged by
          laissez-faire capitalism, which polluted even the artistic genius.
          Ruskin believed
          <span

            about="JamesMcNeillWhistler"
            data-label="James McNeill Whistler"
            >Whistler</span
          >'s paintings exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery were yet another
          attempt to earn money dishonestly. In his view, the nocturnes did not
          correct any social wrongs and amounted to nothing more than a physical
          manifestation of the very economic system he held in contempt. To
          understand Ruskin, you must see art as a civil responsibility, a
          powerful tool used for the advancement of society. He was among the
          first thinkers to place such great importance on the study of arts.

          also wrote about the trial in his book, The Gentle Art of Making
          Enemies — a controversial collection of grievances against his former
          acquaintances.

          was a visionary. He saw art as an independent field, unrelated to the
          rectification of social faults. Arguably, he set the scene for
          upcoming abstract artists like Jackson Pollock and Joan Miro.

          envisioned a different future for the art world, in which artists
          aren't pinned down by art critics at every attempt to break the mold,
          making art for art's sake!
