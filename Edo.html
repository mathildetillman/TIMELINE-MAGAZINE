          Edo Period in Japan lasted from 1603 to 1867/8. During this time the
          country was ruled by the Tokugawa shogunate. Those 250 years were for
          Japan a time of relative peace, with no civil war (uprisings were
          still happening). This peace together with strict social order and
          isolationist policies resulted in economic development that in turn
          allowed the arts to flourish. It was by no means a just or equal
          society, but neither are the ones we live in. Join us to discover more
          about this unique time in 10 words and 4 art schools.

        <h2>Shogun</h2>
        <p>
          Edo Period starts when Tokugawa Ieyasu becomes the shogun and settles
          his capital in the city of Edo (modern Tokyo). Shogun was what we
          would today call a military dictator, but they were still appointed by
          the emperor. While the emperor and his court held all the prestige, it
          was the shogun who held the power and effectively ruled the country.
          The title of shogun was practically hereditary and, during the Edo
          Period, it remained within the Tokugawa family. A shogun ruled with
          the help of officials known as bakufu (幕府, “tent government”).

        <h2>Daimyo</h2>
        <p>
          Daimyos were fundamental to the shogun's power. Japan, during the Edo
          Period, was a feudal state and daimyos owned the land. Divided into
          three groups depending on their proximity to the Tokugawa family, they
          were responsible for local government in their domains. Initially, the
          taxes levied on the peasants made them very rich, but gradually the
          lavish lifestyle made many of them indebted to the merchants, who
          interestingly were not taxed as one of the lowest classes of Japanese
          society. The state thought it distasteful to tax such parasitic
          activities as trade.

        <h2>Samurai</h2>
        <p>
          Samurai were the soldiers, some of them reporting directly to the
          shogun, others kept as retainers by daimyos. Samurais didn’t own the
          land and didn’t work, for it would be beneath them. Combat was their
          only occupation, but in a period as peaceful as the Edo Period, there
          wasn’t that much fighting to do, so many samurai also devoted their
          time to arts. It was common for samurai to be well educated and enjoy
          many social privileges. Shortly after the Edo Period, their role
          became obsolete, as it was much cheaper to have conscript soldiers
          that we know from the modern armies. But they utilized the experience
          gained during the Edo Period in managing daimyo estates and many of
          them moved into business and professional roles.

        <h2>Sankin-kōtai</h2>
        <p>
          Sankin-kōtai was a policy that helped shoguns keep their friends close
          and enemies closer. It mandated the daimyos to spend every other year
          in Edo (today's Tokyo), and also, their families had to permanently
          live in Edo. It allowed for easier connection to the central power but
          was also a subtle form of holding hostages in case the daimyos had any
          ideas about uprising. For the shogunate, it had the added benefit of
          draining daimyos’ financial resources by maintaining two lavish
          residences; this further assured they would not wage war.

        <h2>Sakoku and Rangaku</h2>
        <p>
          Edo Period was also a time of great isolationism in Japan. Sakoku was
          a doctrine that aimed at keeping westerners out of Japan. From the
          1630s, foreigners were not allowed to step on Japanese land, and
          breaking this rule was punishable by death on the spot. Also, any
          Japanese wanting to leave the country were not allowed to come back.
          At certain times during the Edo Period, shipbuilding was banned. It
          does not mean that there was no foreign trade, however. There was
          extensive trade with China through the port of Nagasaki, in the far
          west of Japan, with a residential area for the Chinese. The policy
          stated that the only European influence permitted was the Dutch
          factory at Dejima in Nagasaki. This presence did not break the rules
          of sakoku, because Dejima was an artificial island, and hence not
          considered part of Japan.

        <p>
          And this is where we get to Rangaku (“Dutch learning”). As much as
          Japan wanted to keep the outsiders out, it was still keen to learn of
          the progress their enemies were making. Rangaku was a body of
          knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch
          enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western
          technology and medicine. It helped Japan during the Meiji Restoration
          to catch up very quickly with western progress.

        <h2>Hankō and Terakoya</h2>
        <p>
          I already mentioned that samurai were well educated. In general, the
          population of Japan during the Edo Period was relatively well
          educated, especially in the higher echelons. Hankō or han schools were
          established to educate the children of daimyos and samurai in the
          local feudal domains. Those were state schools and, initially, the
          curriculum focused on Confucian studies. With time, however, access to
          schools was broadened beyond the daimyo and samurai, and the
          curriculum was significantly extended to cover training in classical
          Japanese studies, medicine, and the various branches of Western
          learning including mathematics, astronomy, military science, and
          ballistics.

        <p>
          Terakoya were different from hankō in that they were private schools
          aimed at the common classes, mostly merchants, who had the money but
          were quite low standing in society. Initially, the schools were often
          existing within the Buddhist temples, but later they also often found
          space in private homes of the upper classes. The curriculum began with
          calligraphy courses and then grew to include counting with the abacus,
          history, and geography. They taught about the daily lives of people,
          household precepts, conversation skills, and moral values, as well as
          historical and geographical topics, which showed a wider scope of
          social life to the students.

        <h2>Ukiyo</h2>
        <p>
          Ukiyo meaning the floating world is a term used to describe the urban
          culture that developed during the Edo Period. During that time,
          especially when the higher classes moved to the cities, peace combined
          with economic progress allowed for the development of the culture of
          leisure. The merchant classes, positioned at the bottom of the social
          order, benefited the most from Edo's rapid economic growth, and began
          to indulge in and patronise the entertainment of kabuki theatre,
          geisha, and courtesans of the pleasure districts; the term ukiyo came
          to describe this hedonistic lifestyle. Ukiyo culture developed in
          Yoshiwara, the licensed red-light district of Edo. It was a culture
          focused on the enjoyment of life and pleasure.

        </figure>

        <h2>Ukiyo-e</h2>
        <p>
          A style of woodblock prints that developed with the rise of Ukiyo
          culture. The subject matter ranged from female beauties; kabuki actors
          and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes
          and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica or scenes of gore.
          Hishikawa Moronobu was one of the first representatives of this style
          in its mature form. His prints were monochrome or colored by hand. But
          color printing soon followed. By the 18th century, we can admire the
          works of such titans as Torii Kiyonaga, Utamaro, and Sharaku. The
          tradition continued in the 19th century with such accomplishments as
          The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō by Hiroshige or Hokusai's The
          Great Wave off Kanagawa. Sadly with the death of those two masters and
          the end of the Edo Period, the days of Ukiyo-e were limited.

        <p>
          With a period so culturally rich as Edo, it is difficult to summarize
          it in a few paragraphs, but hopefully the above gave you a quick
          glimpse into that time. And whet your appetite to explore more about
          this fascinating time when Japan closed its borders to outsiders and
          flourished within itself. The art they created was so deeply
          influential that it heavily impacted artists in the West.
