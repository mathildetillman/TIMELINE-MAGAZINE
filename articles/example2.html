<p>Why <span id="mention-144" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span> says he could not have confessed to jailhouse snitch</p>

<p>The clock is ticking for death row inmate <span id="mention-145" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span>, and the jailhouse informant who helped put him there said he has no regrets about his participation in the case.</p>

<p><span id="mention-69" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> has spent more than three decades on <span id="mention-180" class="mention place" about="Florida" data-label="Florida" data-wikidata-id="Q812">Florida</span>’s death row for the brutal 1985 murder of 14-year-old <span id="mention-213" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio" data-sort="BoggioShelly" data-label="Shelly Boggio">Shelly Boggio</span>. He has appealed, time and again, each time unsuccessful, and he’s running out of options.</p>

<p>Since his 1987 conviction, <span id="mention-70" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, a 74-year-old <span id="mention-257" class="mention place" about="Vietnam" data-label="Vietnam" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Vietnam</span> War veteran, has maintained his innocence. <span id="mention-71" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s legal team said there’s no evidence -- eyewitness, physical or forensic -- to tie <span id="mention-72" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> to the teen’s killing, and that prosecutors relied on the word of jailhouse informants to win a conviction, one of whom was <span id="mention-63" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik" data-sort="SkalnikPaul" data-label="Paul Skalnik">Paul Skalnik</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-1" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was a storied con man with a long rap sheet. Yet, he served as a witness in 35 different cases, helping send dozens to prison and three others to death row.</p>

<p>During <span id="mention-73" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s trial, his current legal team said <span id="mention-2" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> lied on the witness stand when cross-examined about his past criminal history and lied when he claimed <span id="mention-74" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> had confessed to him he committed the crime.</p>

<p><span id="mention-280" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews" data-label="ABC News">ABC News</span> tracked down <span id="mention-3" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> in a nursing home, in <span id="mention-268" class="mention place" about="Corsicana" data-label="Corsicana" data-wikidata-id="Q939602">Corsicana</span>, <span id="mention-239" class="mention place" about="Texas" data-label="Texas" data-wikidata-id="Q1439">Texas</span>, in January. He agreed that he helped put <span id="mention-75" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> on death row.</p>

<p>When asked if he lied on the stand, as <span id="mention-76" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> alleged, <span id="mention-4" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> said, simply, “there’s a time and a place to talk.”</p>

<p>Did he have any regrets? “Not to my knowledge,” <span id="mention-5" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> said.</p>

<p><span id="mention-77" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> has had one stay of execution, but a new date could be set at any moment. He said he has nothing to say to the man who helped put him there.</p>

<p>“I wouldn't say anything to him [<span id="mention-6" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>],” <span id="mention-78" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> told <span id="mention-281" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>' Matt Gutman in an interview from death row. “He wouldn't hear [it]. He's just so self-absorbed, so narcissistic, such a big con man, and he's a child rapist.”</p>

<p><span id="mention-80" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s legal team hasn’t given up the fight. Josh Dubin, <span id="mention-81" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s co-lead counsel, is an Innocence Project advisor and renowned advocate for the wrongfully convicted. In 2018, Dubin won a case that freed an innocent man from <span id="mention-181" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>’s death row. Now he’s on <span id="mention-82" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s case with the same goal.</p>

<p><span id="mention-7" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> died two months after speaking with <span id="mention-284" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. <span id="mention-83" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s co-defendant, <span id="mention-178" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy" data-sort="PearcyJack" data-label="Jack Pearcy">Jack Pearcy</span>, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of <span id="mention-203" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> and was <span id="mention-84" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s housemate at the time of the murder, signed a declaration last December stating that he alone killed Shelly.</p>

<p>“<span id="mention-147" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span> had nothing to do with the murder of <span id="mention-214" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Shelly Boggio</span>,” the declaration said. “I committed the crime alone. <span id="mention-148" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span> was back at the house when I drove <span id="mention-215" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Shelly Boggio</span> to the place where I ultimately killed her.”</p>

<p>But <span id="mention-155" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> refused to testify to this at a hearing on March 10, instead insisting he was innocent.</p>

<p>“I've done 35 years for a crime I didn't commit and I don't plan on testifying against somebody else to help the State kill them and that will be all my testimony could basically do, so I have nothing else to say,” <span id="mention-156" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> said at the hearing.</p>

<p>Now, <span id="mention-88" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s legal team is appealing for a new trial to the Supreme Court of <span id="mention-182" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> or clemency from <span id="mention-183" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> Gov. Ron Desantis.</p>

<h2>What happened to <span id="mention-217" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Shelly Boggio</span>?</h2>

<p>On May 5, 1985. <span id="mention-218" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Shelly Boggio</span> and her twin sister were with a friend near <span id="mention-263" class="mention place" about="StPetersburg" data-label="St. Petersburg" data-wikidata-id="Q49236">St. Petersburg</span>, <span id="mention-184" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>, when they were picked up by <span id="mention-158" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>, then 29, <span id="mention-89" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, then 38, and Oza Dwain Shaw, <span id="mention-159" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>’s friend from Kansas, then 28.</p>

<p><span id="mention-90" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said, “we drove back to our place and smoked some dope and drank some beer.”</p>

<p>Afterwards, <span id="mention-91" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said he, <span id="mention-160" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>, Shelly, Shelly’s sister, their friend and Gayle Bailey, <span id="mention-161" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>’s pregnant girlfriend at the time, got back in the car. <span id="mention-92" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said they dropped Shelly’s sister and the friend off and then the four that remained went to a local bar.</p>

<p><span id="mention-94" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said they left the bar around midnight and went back to the house. According to <span id="mention-95" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, <span id="mention-162" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> said he would drive Shelly home.</p>

<p>Shaw had not gone to the bar but stayed behind at the house. When <span id="mention-163" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> said he was going out again to drop Shelly off at home, Shaw told police in a 1985 interview that he asked him for a ride to the payphone to call his girlfriend, which <span id="mention-164" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> agreed to do.</p>

<p><span id="mention-96" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> insists he did not go with them. “I went in my bedroom, went to sleep,” he said.</p>

<p>While he was at the payphone, Shaw told police <span id="mention-165" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> and Shelly waited in the car. After a bit, he told authorities <span id="mention-166" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> and Shelly “got impatient and was honking” so he told them to leave him.</p>

<p><span id="mention-254" class="mention person" about="ChelseaShirley" data-sort="ShirleyChelsea" data-label="Chelsea Shirley">Chelsea Shirley</span>, <span id="mention-97" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s former appellate attorney, told <span id="mention-285" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> that they have the telephone records to confirm this call was placed at 1:15 a.m.</p>

<p>The medical examiner would later determine that Shelly was murdered sometime between 1:30 and 3:30 a.m.</p>

<p>After hanging up with his girlfriend, Shaw told authorities he walked back to the house. In a 1985 police interview, a detective asked Shaw: “Where was Jimmy [<span id="mention-98" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>] this time you came back from making your phone call?”</p>

<p>“He wasn't in the living room or I think he was in bed, in the bedroom,” Shaw said. “I'm not sure.”</p>

<p>Shaw told detectives <span id="mention-167" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> returned to the house hours later, alone, around 4 a.m. <span id="mention-99" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said <span id="mention-168" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> then came into his room and woke him up.</p>

<p>“[He] said, ‘I've got a couple of joints. Let's go smoke them,’ and grabbed a six pack of beer out of the fridge," <span id="mention-100" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said.</p>

<p><span id="mention-101" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said he got out of bed and he and <span id="mention-169" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> drove out to the Belleair Causeway, a bridge near <span id="mention-264" class="mention place" about="StPetersburg">St. Petersburg</span>. He said he and <span id="mention-170" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> threw a frisbee around by the waterside there. The frisbee went into the water and he got his pants wet when he fished it out, he said, and then after a while, the two men returned home.</p>

<p>“The next morning, the bridge tender finds Shelly's body mutilated and she's naked and she's dead,” Carol Martin, a juror who served on the trial, told <span id="mention-286" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>.</p>

<p>Shelly's body was found floating in the waters of the <span id="mention-279" class="mention place" about="IntracoastalWaterway" data-label="Intracoastal Waterway" data-wikidata-id="Q756421">Intracoastal Waterway</span> near the <span id="mention-278" class="mention place" about="IndianRocksBeach" data-label="Indian Rocks Beach" data-wikidata-id="Q992514">Indian Rocks Beach</span> drawbridge. She had been stabbed more than 30 times. Authorities said she had fought back and had a number of defensive wounds.</p>

<p>Shelly’s cousin Andrea <span id="mention-210" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> recently went to the place where her body was found 35 years earlier for the first time. She still couldn’t believe something so horrific had happened to the young teen, whom she described as being "very kind, very sweet" and "very soft spoken."</p>

<p>“How could somebody kill a little girl and just leave them in the water,” <span id="mention-211" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> said. “What drives somebody to do that? The devil. An evil, evil person.”</p>


<h2><span id="mention-102" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> and <span id="mention-171" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> go to trial</h2>

<p><span id="mention-103" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> and <span id="mention-172" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> were arrested and indicted on first-degree murder charges. At the time, <span id="mention-173" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> told authorities that <span id="mention-104" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> killed Shelly and that he was sleeping in his car when the murder took place.</p>

<p><span id="mention-105" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> maintained that he never saw Shelly again after she, <span id="mention-174" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> and Shaw left to go to the payphone.</p>

<p>Both Shaw and Bailey told police in 1985 interviews that <span id="mention-106" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s pants were wet when he and <span id="mention-175" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> returned home the morning of May 6.</p>

<p>The two men were tried separately, with <span id="mention-176" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> going first in 1986. The jury convicted him quickly, but recommended life in prison instead of a death sentence. The following summer, <span id="mention-107" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s case went to trial.</p>

<p>“The state's theory was that Jack, Jim <span id="mention-108" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, and Shelly left and that they drove around, then they went to the waterside,” <span id="mention-252" class="mention person" about="ChelseaShirley">Shirley</span> said.</p>

<p>Dubin told <span id="mention-287" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> “there was just no evidence” to tie <span id="mention-109" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> to the killing, adding that <span id="mention-110" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> "didn't have a history of violence against women. He didn't have a motive.”</p>

<p>At trial, prosecutors called a trio of jailhouse informants who were in jail with <span id="mention-112" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> while he was awaiting trial. Two of them testified that <span id="mention-113" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> made incriminating statements, but then the third inmate, <span id="mention-8" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, took the stand, and <span id="mention-114" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s attorneys claim he was a show-stopper.</p>

<p>At the time, <span id="mention-9" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was in jail on a pending charge for grand theft. He testified that <span id="mention-115" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> confessed to him that "the young girl kept staring at him, screaming and would not die. And he stabbed her and he threw the knife away.”</p>

<p>When asked about his reaction to <span id="mention-10" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s testimony, <span id="mention-116" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said, “Well, other than disbelief, other than trying to tell my attorney that never happened, it was just sickening.”</p>

<p><span id="mention-117" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said he didn’t kill Shelly and never confessed to <span id="mention-11" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> or anybody else. “Absolutely not.”</p>

<p>He said everyone in the jail knew <span id="mention-12" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was a snitch. He maintains that weeks before his trial, he was moved to the same wing of the <span id="mention-193" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> Jail as <span id="mention-13" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>. <span id="mention-14" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, <span id="mention-118" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> says, was in a single cell, and that he was in a pod of about 16 prisoners.</p>

<p>“According to <span id="mention-64" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Paul Skalnik</span>, as he's walking down the hallway, <span id="mention-119" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> shouts at him through this double layer of bars, ‘Oh hey, let me talk to you,’” <span id="mention-253" class="mention person" about="ChelseaShirley">Shirley</span> said. “So according to <span id="mention-16" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, they talk. Mr. <span id="mention-120" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> says, you know, he killed her."</p>

<p>In other words, <span id="mention-121" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said, “I would have had to yell my confession to him, and there's always guys sitting at the table right there, playing cards.”</p>


<p>The jury was told by both the prosecution and <span id="mention-17" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> that he was not promised anything or given a deal in exchange for his testimony against <span id="mention-122" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>. The jury never heard <span id="mention-123" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s explanation for having wet pants because he never took the stand, though <span id="mention-124" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said he wanted to testify.</p>

<p>“I wanted to get up and tell what really happened,” he said. “I don't know why-- my attorney at that trial said that he didn't want me to testify because he couldn't believe that we played Frisbee.”</p>

<p>But because <span id="mention-125" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> never testified, Martin, a juror on the case, said <span id="mention-18" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s testimony was the only information the jury had that "supposably" came from <span id="mention-126" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>.</p>

<p>“If we were to believe what the snitches were saying, that was the only way we could hear <span id="mention-152" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span>'s voice,” said Martin. "It was very interesting, listening to the snitches."</p>

<p><span id="mention-128" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1987.</p>

<p>“I went out, sat down on a bench,” <span id="mention-129" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said. “And there was a mental health guy there. And I just started crying. He says, ‘What's the matter?’ And I said, ‘Well, I was just sentenced to death for a crime I didn't commit.’”</p>

<p>Five days after <span id="mention-130" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was sentenced to death, <span id="mention-19" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was released from jail on his own recognizance, which meant he did not have to put up bail on the pending grand theft charge. Then he skipped town.</p>

<h2>The perfect liar?</h2>

<p>Born in 1949, <span id="mention-20" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was adopted young, raised in League City, <span id="mention-240" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span>. He started out on the right track, according to school yearbooks: student council, the Key Club, and he was even voted president of the Future Business Leaders of America. After high school, he went to the New Mexico Military Institute for a short stint. Then went on to become a police officer, for just over a year, in Austin, <span id="mention-241" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span>.</p>

<p>But then his life took a drastic turn.</p>

<p>“He was charged with theft,” said former <span id="mention-242" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> prosecutor <span id="mention-276" class="mention person" about="MargaretHindman" data-sort="HindmanMargaret" data-label="Margaret Hindman">Margaret Hindman</span>. “It was a bunch of hot checks.”</p>

<p><span id="mention-21" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was allowed to resign from the force and slipped into a new career as an insurance agent. By age 30, <span id="mention-22" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> had divorced twice. His third wife was Penny <span id="mention-230" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers" data-label="Rogers">Rogers</span>.</p>

<p>According to <span id="mention-231" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Rogers</span>’ daughter, <span id="mention-23" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was a master manipulator who at first swept Penny right off her feet when they met in 1977.</p>

<p>“I thought my mother had found the most wonderful guy,” <span id="mention-237" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Lisa Rogers</span> told <span id="mention-288" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. “He told me I was his princess and that I could call him Dad, but I never did. He told her that he was CEO of Southwest Airlines. He would get dressed in a three-piece suit, all his gold and diamonds.”</p>

<p>Not long after her mother married <span id="mention-24" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, <span id="mention-238" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Lisa Rogers</span> said, “He got to be very abusive. He would lock my brother up in a room, beat him. My mom, he would beat her. He ... started touching me inappropriately. I was like, ‘What did I do? What did I do to make him do that?’”</p>

<p><span id="mention-25" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> never faced charges for crimes <span id="mention-234" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Rogers</span> said he committed against her and her family, but by spring 1978, <span id="mention-26" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> found himself in a <span id="mention-246" class="mention place" about="Houston" data-label="Houston" data-wikidata-id="Q16555">Houston</span> jail for passing a dozen bad checks. Once he was released, <span id="mention-235" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Rogers</span> said <span id="mention-27" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> disappeared.</p>

<p>“He was engaged to another woman in <span id="mention-185" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> while being married to my mom,” <span id="mention-236" class="mention person" about="RozelleRogers">Rogers</span> said.</p>

<p><span id="mention-28" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> continued committing crimes. In 1982, <span id="mention-226" class="mention person" about="KarenParker" data-sort="ParkerKaren" data-label="Karen Parker">Karen Parker</span> was just 12 years old, a 7th grader, when she says <span id="mention-29" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> showed up “out of the blue,” an acquaintance of a neighbor, in <span id="mention-186" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>. <span id="mention-30" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was 32 at the time.</p>

<p>One day, <span id="mention-221" class="mention person" about="KarenParker">Parker</span> says, she and others in the neighborhood were supposed to go fishing when <span id="mention-31" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> summoned her to his car.</p>

<p>“It was dark,” <span id="mention-222" class="mention person" about="KarenParker">Parker</span> said. “His windows were tinted. And he pulled me in and started kissing me on the mouth-- like an adult would kiss an-- another adult. And-- he grabbed my hand and put it in his pants. I couldn't believe it was happening. I felt like where's all the adults?”</p>

<p>Ultimately, <span id="mention-223" class="mention person" about="KarenParker">Parker</span> told authorities and <span id="mention-32" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was charged with lewd and lascivious conduct on a child. He was facing 15 years if convicted. <span id="mention-224" class="mention person" about="KarenParker">Parker</span> passed a polygraph. There were witnesses who say they saw this, and in a strange bit of irony, <span id="mention-33" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> allegedly told someone, in jail, that he committed the crime. Still, the charge was dropped because the state attorney's office determined there was insufficient evidence and <span id="mention-34" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> instead pleaded no contest to a pending grand theft charge.</p>

<p>When asked about <span id="mention-131" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, <span id="mention-225" class="mention person" about="KarenParker">Parker</span> said she doesn't know if he's innocent or guilty of murdering <span id="mention-219" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Shelly Boggio</span> but that "if any of his sentencing is based on the testimony of <span id="mention-65" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Paul Skalnik</span>, that should be wiped away and start over because he's a perfect liar."</p>

<p><span id="mention-36" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>'s plea deal kept him in the <span id="mention-194" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> Jail.</p>

<p>While in <span id="mention-195" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> Jail, <span id="mention-37" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> claimed that a fellow inmate, <span id="mention-262" class="mention person" about="Gardner" data-sort="GardnerKenneth" data-label="Kenneth Gardner">Kenneth Gardner</span>, confessed to him for the murder of a hardware store owner in <span id="mention-256" class="mention place" about="Clearwater">Clearwater</span>, <span id="mention-187" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>.</p>

<p>“<span id="mention-38" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was claiming at that time that Mr. <span id="mention-259" class="mention person" about="Gardner">Gardner</span> had made a statement to him to the effect of, "I killed him, but no one will be able to prove it," Frank Louderback, who represented <span id="mention-260" class="mention person" about="Gardner">Gardner</span>, told <span id="mention-289" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-261" class="mention person" about="Gardner">Gardner</span> was convicted, and <span id="mention-39" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, was later paroled after serving half of a five-year sentence for grand theft. But <span id="mention-40" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> wouldn’t stay out of jail, and he kept gathering confessions.</p>

<p>“Prosecutors used him an awful lot,” Ronnie Crider told <span id="mention-290" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>.</p>

<p>Crider, an attorney who defended <span id="mention-177" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>, said he became familiar with <span id="mention-41" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> during another case and even took his deposition.</p>

<p>“I asked him how many times he'd actually been listed as a witness by the state,” Crider said. “And he told me 28.”</p>

<p>Documents obtained by <span id="mention-291" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> reveal that <span id="mention-188" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> used <span id="mention-42" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> as a witness in 35 cases in <span id="mention-196" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> alone.</p>

<p>“Suddenly <span id="mention-43" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, who was unknown to me... became known as what appeared to be the state attorney's go-to witness,” said Louderback.</p>


<p>In one case involving <span id="mention-44" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> as an informant, the state’s attorney’s case file included a handwritten note that says that if <span id="mention-45" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s assistance "in previous discussed cases is substantial, the state will be seeking to mitigate -- Probation was discussed!"</p>

<p><span id="mention-46" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was not just a witness for the state attorney's office. In 1984, one <span id="mention-197" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> detective, <span id="mention-201" class="mention person" about="JohnHalliday" data-sort="HallidayJohn" data-label="John Halliday">John Halliday</span>, wrote to the parole board in support of granting <span id="mention-47" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s parole while he was serving time for the grand theft conviction, saying "<span id="mention-48" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> has to my knowledge testified in excess of thirty (30) criminal trials in which six (6) inmates received the death penalty.</p>

<p><span id="mention-49" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was paroled. But not for long. Just two years later, <span id="mention-50" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was back in <span id="mention-198" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> Jail again, where he would claim <span id="mention-132" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> confessed to him.</p>

<p>Five days after <span id="mention-133" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> is sentenced to death, <span id="mention-51" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was released from jail, “due to his cooperation in the first-degree murder trial where he was a witness,” according to internal <span id="mention-189" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> Parole Commission documents obtained by <span id="mention-292" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. <span id="mention-52" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was released from jail without having to post bail on the pending grand theft charge. Then he skipped town.</p>

<p><span id="mention-200" class="mention person" about="JohnHalliday">Halliday</span> declined to be interviewed by <span id="mention-293" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> for this story.</p>

<p>Stephen Thompson, a spokesperson for the 6th Circuit prosecutor's office submitted a statement to <span id="mention-294" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> saying, “we don’t typically comment on any cases… The judges' decisions in court speak for themselves.”</p>

<h2>What happened to <span id="mention-53" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> after <span id="mention-134" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s trial</h2>

<p>After the <span id="mention-135" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> case, <span id="mention-54" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> made his way back to <span id="mention-243" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> where he met the mother of <span id="mention-250" class="mention person" about="Anderson" data-sort="AndersonMisty" data-label="Misty Anderson">Misty Anderson</span>. But before long, <span id="mention-248" class="mention person" about="Anderson">Anderson</span> said, <span id="mention-55" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was sexually assaulting her. “The horrible things he did still live in my nightmares.”</p>

<p>“I was an assistant criminal district attorney,” <span id="mention-277" class="mention person" about="MargaretHindman">Margaret Hindman</span> told <span id="mention-295" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. “This was a sexual assault of a child-- he had really groomed this little girl. Of course, he denied it.”</p>

<p><span id="mention-275" class="mention person" about="MargaretHindman">Hindman</span> says <span id="mention-56" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> claimed to be working for the CIA as an informant for the FBI and used the alias “Jason Paul Bourne,” seeming to refer to the Robert Ludlum novels.</p>

<p><span id="mention-57" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was convicted in 1993 of sexual assault of a child and sentenced to 10 years in a <span id="mention-244" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> prison.</p>

<p>When <span id="mention-296" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> caught up with <span id="mention-58" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, he had been released after serving his time in prison for the <span id="mention-249" class="mention person" about="Anderson">Anderson</span> case. He said that in the years since then, he had moved to Massachusetts, had more brushes with the law, served more time, and was back in <span id="mention-245" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span>.</p>

<p>When asked if he wanted to see <span id="mention-136" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> put to death, <span id="mention-59" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> said, "there are times and moments, yes."</p>

<p><span id="mention-60" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> died two months after our interview.</p>

<p><span id="mention-272" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman" data-sort="HeymanRobert" data-label="Robert Heyman">Robert Heyman</span>, one of the prosecutors at <span id="mention-137" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s trial, said the state was aware <span id="mention-61" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was a professional con man when he testified against <span id="mention-138" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>.</p>

<p>“<span id="mention-62" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, you know, we vetted him,” <span id="mention-270" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> said. “I know he's been under attack as a professional snitch… we checked him out.”</p>

<p><span id="mention-271" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> maintains that justice has been served in <span id="mention-139" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s case.</p>

<p>“I think that's an appropriate sentence under the law of the state of <span id="mention-190" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>,” he said. “Do you know how many times this has been reviewed by the courts, both in the state and the federal levels? And they seem to have been satisfied so far.”</p>

<p>And now, at any moment, the governor of <span id="mention-191" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span> could sign a death warrant for <span id="mention-141" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid to die," <span id="mention-142" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> said. "What I'm afraid of is spending the rest of my life in prison for a crime I didn't commit, not being able to clear my name for my kids and my grandkids and my great-grandkids.”</p>
