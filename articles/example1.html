<p><span id="mention-89" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey" data-sort="DaileyJames" data-label="James Dailey">James Dailey</span> is staring death in the face.</p>

<p>Unless something drastic changes, it’s likely just a matter of when.</p>

<p><span id="mention-37" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was sentenced to die in August 1987 for the brutal stabbing and drowning of a 14-year-old girl, <span id="mention-141" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio" data-sort="BoggioShelly" data-label="Shelly Boggio">Shelly Boggio</span> -- a horrific crime that stunned the nation. Both he and his roommate, <span id="mention-114" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy" data-sort="PearcyJack" data-label="Jack Pearcy">Jack Pearcy</span>, were found guilty of the murder. <span id="mention-98" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> received life in prison but <span id="mention-38" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> got death.</p>

<p>For more than three decades, he has sat on death row in <span id="mention-116" class="mention place" about="Florida" data-label="Florida" data-wikidata-id="Q812">Florida</span>, all while proclaiming his innocence.</p>

<p>Time is now running out and <span id="mention-39" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, a 73-year-old <span id="mention-151" class="mention place" about="Vietnam" data-label="Vietnam" data-wikidata-id="Q881">Vietnam</span> War veteran, is making a last-ditch effort to avoid execution.</p>

<p>The entire case, and <span id="mention-41" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s life in fact, hang in large part on the word of <span id="mention-33" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik" data-sort="SkalnikPaul" data-label="Paul Skalnik">Paul Skalnik</span>, a 70-year-old former <span id="mention-143" class="mention place" about="Texas" data-label="Texas" data-wikidata-id="Q1439">Texas</span> police officer and a conman, who made a career out of being a jailhouse informant and whom <span id="mention-187" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> found living in a <span id="mention-144" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> nursing home.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the world may never know if <span id="mention-42" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> is an innocent man, as he claims, even after <span id="mention-99" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> changed his story and confessed to being <span id="mention-127" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>'s sole killer in a 2017 affidavit (that affidavit was later deemed inadmissible after <span id="mention-100" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> refused to answer questions about it on the stand and testified that its contents were false).</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid to die," <span id="mention-43" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> told <span id="mention-188" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> in an exclusive interview from death row. "What I'm afraid of is spending the rest of my life in prison for a crime I didn't commit, not being able to clear my name for my kids and my grandkids and my great-grandkids."</p>

<p><span id="mention-44" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s case highlights the controversial use of jailhouse informants in criminal cases and the expectation of leniency from law enforcement and prosecutors for their information and testimony, which critics say creates an incentive to lie.</p>

<p>To that point, according to the <span id="mention-199" class="mention organization" about="NationalRegistryofExonerations" data-label="National Registry of Exonerations">National Registry of Exonerations</span>, -- a joint project from the University of <span id="mention-210" class="mention place" about="California" data-label="California">California</span> Irvine, the <span id="mention-203" class="mention organization" about="UniversityofMichiganLawSchool" data-label="University of Michigan Law School">University of Michigan Law School</span> and <span id="mention-204" class="mention organization" about="MichiganStateUniversityCollegeofLaw" data-label="Michigan State University College of Law">Michigan State University College of Law</span> -- nearly 200 people had their convictions overturned since 1968 in cases where a jailhouse informant was used at trial, including 27 who were sentenced to death.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of disclosure: whether and prosecutors and other law enforcement officials are forthcoming in court about promises made to informants.</p>

<p>While the <span id="mention-205" class="mention organization" about="SupremeCourt" data-label="Supreme Court">Supreme Court</span> has ruled that prosecutors have a constitutional obligation to disclose information that could potentially benefit the defense, advocates say this does not go far enough in specifying what type of information has to be disclosed.</p>

<p>And while a number of states have made attempts to address the issue of jailhouse informants by creating programs that monitor their use, some experts say these measures don’t go far enough.</p>

<h2>A chilling murder</h2>

<p><span id="mention-180" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman" data-sort="HeymanRobert" data-label="Robert Heyman">Robert Heyman</span>, one of the prosecutors in <span id="mention-45" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s murder trial, told <span id="mention-189" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> in an interview that he remembers <span id="mention-128" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>'s case vividly.</p>

<p><span id="mention-129" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> was a 14-year-old who was hitchhiking with her twin sister and a friend near <span id="mention-163" class="mention place" about="StPetersburg" data-label="St. Petersburg" data-wikidata-id="Q49236">St. Petersburg</span> in May 1985 when they were picked up by <span id="mention-46" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> and <span id="mention-101" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>.</p>

<p>After a night of partying, <span id="mention-130" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> and <span id="mention-102" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> left together.</p>

<p>Witnesses said that <span id="mention-131" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> was alone with <span id="mention-103" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> for a period of time, but the prosecution argued that <span id="mention-47" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> rejoined the couple later that night and was the one who held the young girl’s head under water, drowning her.</p>

<p>The girl’s body was found with 31 stab wounds in the <span id="mention-117" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>'s <span id="mention-181" class="mention place" about="IntracoastalWaterway" data-label="Intracoastal Waterway" data-wikidata-id="Q756421">Intracoastal Waterway</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-104" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> was convicted of <span id="mention-132" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>'s murder in 1986 and a jury put him behind bars for life.</p>

<p>The following year, <span id="mention-49" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was also tried on first-degree murder charges. Unlike his roommate, he was sentenced to death.</p>

<p><span id="mention-172" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> maintained that <span id="mention-50" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was the most culpable and "decided to wade out there, waist deep, and hold her under the water until she drowned," he said. "I think it was powerful at the guilt phase, and it was powerful when the jury decided whether or not <span id="mention-51" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> should get death."</p>

<p>But advocates point to a lack of physical evidence that implicates <span id="mention-52" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-173" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> conceded in the same interview that there "was nothing that was found on her (<span id="mention-133" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>) that could link her to either <span id="mention-53" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> or <span id="mention-105" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>" and "the weapon, the--the knife was never found."</p>

<p>Specifically, there was no physical evidence to connect <span id="mention-54" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> to the more than two dozen stab wounds <span id="mention-134" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> sustained. Instead, prosecutors hinged their case on testimony from a friend who saw <span id="mention-55" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> the night of the murder returning home wearing wet pants, <span id="mention-106" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>'s statement after his arrest that <span id="mention-56" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> killed the girl and the word of three jailhouse informants.</p>

<p><span id="mention-57" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, who was 38 at the time of <span id="mention-135" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>'s death, has always maintained his innocence.</p>

<h2>181 overturned cases</h2>

<p>The use of jailhouse informants has been a subject of heated debate for years.</p>

<p>For instance, in <span id="mention-152" class="mention place" about="OrangeCounty" data-label="Orange County" data-wikidata-id="Q5925">Orange County</span>, <span id="mention-211" class="mention place" about="California">California</span>, claims by public defender <span id="mention-209" class="mention person" about="ScottSanders" data-label="Scott Sanders">Scott Sanders</span> sparked a years-long investigation by state prosecutors after <span id="mention-208" class="mention person" about="ScottSanders">Sanders</span> argued that jailhouse informants had improperly obtained statements from his clients awaiting trial. He also claimed that <span id="mention-153" class="mention place" about="OrangeCounty">Orange County</span> prosecutors had withheld information about these informants that could have helped exonerate his clients.</p>

<p>Last year, the <span id="mention-212" class="mention place" about="California">California</span> attorney general -- which investigated the alleged misconduct with jailhouse informants -- announced they were dropping the investigation.</p>

<p>However, the U.S. Department of Justice and the <span id="mention-154" class="mention place" about="OrangeCounty">Orange County</span> District Attorney <span id="mention-215" class="mention person" about="ToddSpitzer" data-label="Todd Spitzer">Todd Spitzer</span> have ongoing investigations into the alleged misuse of jailhouse informants and are focusing on some previous prosecutions within the office, according to the <span id="mention-216" class="mention organization" about="OrangeCountyRegister" data-label="Orange County Register">Orange County Register</span>.</p>

<blockquote><span id="mention-174" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> admitted that there 'was nothing that was found on her (<span id="mention-136" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>) that could link her to either <span id="mention-58" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> or <span id="mention-107" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>.'</blockquote>

<p>Since <span id="mention-214" class="mention person" about="ToddSpitzer">Spitzer</span> was sworn in, in January 2019, no jailhouse informants have been used for any criminal trials and a policy was implemented where he has to personally approve the usage of any jailhouse informant, <span id="mention-218" class="mention person" about="KimberlyEdds" data-label="Kimberly Edds">Kimberly Edds</span>, spokeswoman for the <span id="mention-156" class="mention place" about="OrangeCounty">Orange County</span> DA’s office, told <span id="mention-190" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>.</p>

<p>Experts say that the potential offer of leniency combined with the prospect of continued confinement creates a potent incentive for informants not to be truthful.</p>

<p>"Anytime there is a jailhouse snitch in a case, anyone with a shred of common sense can see that this is someone who is looking for something -- whatever that may be -- in exchange for cooperating," said <span id="mention-222" class="mention person" about="MarkBederow" data-label="Mark Bederow">Mark Bederow</span>, a defense attorney who is currently appealing a 2003 murder case in New York against his client John Giuca, which was tied to the testimony of a jailhouse informant who later recanted.</p>

<p>"Informants don't do this out of the goodness of their heart and prosecutors have to deal with this [off] the bat," said <span id="mention-220" class="mention person" about="MarkBederow">Bederow</span>.“The problem is you have to rely on the prosecutor to disclose the benefits [that the witness received]...If a prosecutor wants to rely on a snitch and is forthright with the information to let the defense expose that to the jury, it will give the jury the opportunity to weigh the case and have a fair evaluation."</p>

<p>In <span id="mention-59" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s case, there was increased pressure to win a death penalty conviction after prosecutors failed to secure the death penalty for <span id="mention-108" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>, according to <span id="mention-60" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s 2018 appeal.</p>

<p>"My sense is that the prosecutor took that as a political loss," said <span id="mention-230" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham" data-label="Robert Dunham">Robert Dunham</span>, the executive director of the <span id="mention-231" class="mention organization" about="DeathPenaltyInformationCenter" data-label="Death Penalty Information Center">Death Penalty Information Center</span>. "The only other person they had as a potential suspect was <span id="mention-93" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">James Dailey</span> and there was evidence that connected him to <span id="mention-109" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>."</p>

<p>"They were roommates and was with him later on the night of the murder," <span id="mention-224" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span> added.</p>

<h2>'Worst type of informant'</h2>

<p><span id="mention-125" class="mention person" about="JohnHalliday" data-sort="HallidayJohn" data-label="John Halliday">John Halliday</span>, the lead detective on the case, went to the jail <span id="mention-63" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was housed in after <span id="mention-110" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span>’s sentencing and began interviewing numerous inmates looking for a potential informant, according to court documents.</p>

<p>No one at that point said they had information about <span id="mention-64" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s case, but his 2018 appeal states that days later, three other inmates came forward claiming that <span id="mention-65" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> had spoken to each of them about the murder.</p>

<p>The testimony of these jailhouse informants "became the linchpin of the State’s case, even though none of their statements possessed any independent indicia of reliability," according to the document.</p>

<p><span id="mention-2" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>'s life as an informant started in <span id="mention-145" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> shortly after he was forced to quit the <span id="mention-232" class="mention organization" about="AustinPoliceDepartment" data-label="Austin Police Department">Austin Police Department</span> in the 1970s for allegedly cashing bad checks, according to <span id="mention-164" class="mention organization" about="TheNewYorkTimes" data-label="The New York Times" data-wikidata-id="Q9684">The New York Times</span> Magazine and <span id="mention-157" class="mention organization" about="ProPublica" data-label="ProPublica" data-wikidata-id="Q1817856">ProPublica</span>, which partnered for an ongoing investigation on jailhouse informants.</p>

<p>Throughout <span id="mention-3" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s adult life, he has been in and out of jail on numerous charges and became a jailhouse informant for 18 murder cases where four of the defendants were sentenced to death -- including <span id="mention-66" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>, according to <span id="mention-165" class="mention organization" about="TheNewYorkTimes">The New York Times</span>/<span id="mention-158" class="mention organization" about="ProPublica">ProPublica</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-67" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s appeal blasted star witness <span id="mention-4" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> as a career conman who was convicted of “at least twenty-five crimes of dishonesty,” gave false statements about corrections officers to have them removed from the jail wings where he was serving and lied on the stand about his violent criminal history at <span id="mention-68" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s trial.</p>

<blockquote>'11 wrongful conviction cases were overturned in 2018 that were linked to a jailhouse informant, according to the National Registry of Exoneration.'</blockquote>

<p>At the time <span id="mention-69" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was booked for <span id="mention-137" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>’s murder, <span id="mention-5" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was in <span id="mention-121" class="mention place" about="PinellasCounty">Pinellas County</span> Jail, the county where <span id="mention-138" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span> was murdered, on grand theft charges. <span id="mention-6" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> alleges <span id="mention-70" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> first asked him for legal advice and then confided in him about the murder. It was a pattern that became a hallmark of how <span id="mention-7" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> claimed he received information, according to <span id="mention-166" class="mention organization" about="TheNewYorkTimes">The New York Times</span>/<span id="mention-159" class="mention organization" about="ProPublica">ProPublica</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-8" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> testified that <span id="mention-71" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> confessed as <span id="mention-9" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was passing by his cell on the way to recreation. "That Mr. <span id="mention-111" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> had actually held the young girl under," <span id="mention-10" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> testified. "Under, I did not know what 'under' was but he said the young girl kept staring at him, screaming and would not die. And he stabbed her and threw the knife away."</p>

<p><span id="mention-72" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> insists he never confessed to <span id="mention-11" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>.</p>

<p>“Everybody in jail knew he was a-- world's biggest snitch, you know? They knew he was an ex-police officer. I mean even the officers in the county jail told us not to talk to him, you know?” <span id="mention-73" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> told <span id="mention-191" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>.</p>

<blockquote><span id="mention-34" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Paul Skalnik</span> told <span id="mention-192" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> from a <span id="mention-146" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> nursing home that he was truthful and has no regrets</blockquote>

<p>"<span id="mention-13" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s behavior while incarcerated precisely mirrored his behavior when not incarcerated: he was willing to say anything, regardless of the truth of the matter, and regardless of whom it might harm, if he believed that doing so would benefit him," <span id="mention-74" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s legal team wrote in his appeal.</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued in their response to <span id="mention-75" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s 2018 appeal that <span id="mention-14" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> willingly contacted authorities, did not receive a deal for his testimony and that the court had already rejected <span id="mention-76" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s claim that <span id="mention-15" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> provided false information.</p>

<p>"You should never rely solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a jailhouse informant," said <span id="mention-225" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span>.</p>

<p><span id="mention-226" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span> said that jailhouse informants are more attracted to high-profile cases such as <span id="mention-139" class="mention person" about="ShellyBoggio">Boggio</span>'s because they think they can reap a greater benefit from prosecutors and law enforcement for their cooperation.</p>

<p>"<span id="mention-16" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, he was the worst type of informant, a serial snitch...yet he has somehow managed to come up with 37 confessions in murder and other felony cases. Eight cases where a defendant was charged with first-degree murder and four end up on death row," said <span id="mention-227" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span>. "The likelihood of that really happening is so remote, its laughable."</p>

<p><span id="mention-17" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> has never been charged with perjury and told <span id="mention-193" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> in a phone interview from his nursing home bed in <span id="mention-147" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> that he was truthful and has no regrets.</p>

<p>At the time of <span id="mention-77" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s case, <span id="mention-18" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was facing the possibility of up to 20 years in prison if convicted of grand theft. <span id="mention-175" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> said that he did not have a deal with <span id="mention-19" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> if he testified at the <span id="mention-78" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> trial. However, five days after<span id="mention-79" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> was sentenced to death, <span id="mention-20" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> was released from jail on his own recognizance and without bond despite a stern warning from his parole officer a year earlier that he was a flight risk, according to <span id="mention-160" class="mention organization" about="ProPublica">ProPublica</span>.</p>

<p>He would go on to serve time for additional offenses, including 10 years in prison for the sexual assault of a child.</p>

<h2>Policy changes</h2>

<p><span id="mention-233" class="mention place" about="Connecticut" data-label="Connecticut">Connecticut</span>, <span id="mention-169" class="mention place" about="Illinois" data-label="Illinois" data-wikidata-id="Q1204">Illinois</span> and <span id="mention-148" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> have made efforts to implement policies to monitor the use of jailhouse informants, like keeping a log of every informant's testimony and turning over disciplinary and visitor records among other documentation.</p>

<p>"If a prosecutor has a problem with disclosing any information, the question should be what's the prosecution trying to hide, transparency benefits the prosecution," said <span id="mention-228" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span>.</p>

<p>Another proposed action by <span id="mention-229" class="mention person" about="RobertDunham">Dunham</span> is to tell the defense and the jury what expectations or plea bargains were made in exchange for the informant's testimony.</p>

<p><span id="mention-149" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> is one example of a state passing reforms regarding government informants. In June 2017, the state passed legislation where prosecutors must keep a comprehensive record of the inmate -- previous cases in which they’ve testified and any benefit they received, along with a complete arrest record -- and to turn over that information to the defense, according to The <span id="mention-168" class="mention place" about="Dallas" data-label="Dallas" data-wikidata-id="Q16557">Dallas</span> Morning News.</p>

<p><span id="mention-150" class="mention place" about="Texas">Texas</span> has had 366 wrongful convictions, according to the <span id="mention-200" class="mention organization" about="NationalRegistryofExonerations">National Registry of Exonerations</span>. Of those, 13 had a jailhouse informant involved with their case and three inmates were sentenced to death.</p>

<p>In <span id="mention-234" class="mention place" about="Connecticut">Connecticut</span>, Gov. <span id="mention-247" class="mention person" about="NedLamont" data-label="Ned Lamont">Ned Lamont</span> signed a wide-ranging bill in July 2019 that has created the nation’s first statewide system to track the use of jailhouse informants, including any benefits offered in exchange for their testimony, the <span id="mention-248" class="mention organization" about="AssociatedPress" data-label="Associated Press">Associated Press</span> reported.</p>

<blockquote>7% of 2559 wrongful convictions had ties to a jailhouse informant's testimony</blockquote>

<p>In November 2018, <span id="mention-170" class="mention place" about="Illinois">Illinois</span> lawmakers amended a law to now require judges to conduct a pre-trial hearing for all cases involving jailhouse informants in order to assess the reliability of their testimony. This policy had been in effect only for death penalty cases, which were then banned in the state in 2011.</p>

<p>"The states that are trying to implement rules to have hearings to seek reliability of an informant are in the right path, but the real issue is having all the information about the witness in front of the jury," said <span id="mention-221" class="mention person" about="MarkBederow">Bederow</span>.</p>

<h2><span id="mention-81" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> awaiting justice</h2>

<p><span id="mention-82" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span> breathed a sigh of relief in October 2019 when a federal judge temporarily tossed his Nov. 7, 2019 execution date in order for his newly assigned attorneys to research and file a motion to vacate his conviction and death sentence.</p>

<p>His appellate attorney, <span id="mention-252" class="mention person" about="JoshDubin" data-label="Josh Dubin">Josh Dubin</span>, filed a motion on Jan. 21 seeking to vacate the conviction alleging a <span id="mention-253" class="mention concept" about="Bradyviolation" data-label="Brady violation">Brady violation</span> -- failing to disclose evidence that's favorable to the defense or can discredit a witness.</p>

<p>"<span id="mention-21" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> had everything to gain," <span id="mention-250" class="mention person" about="JoshDubin">Dubin</span> told <span id="mention-194" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. "And absolutely nothing to lose. He had pending charges against him. He got up on that witness stand, um, and he lied..."</p>

<p>According to <span id="mention-251" class="mention person" about="JoshDubin">Dubin</span>’s motion, <span id="mention-22" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> "perjured" himself about his criminal history on the stand.</p>

<p><span id="mention-167" class="mention organization" about="TheNewYorkTimes">The New York Times</span>/<span id="mention-161" class="mention organization" about="ProPublica">ProPublica</span> investigation points out that <span id="mention-23" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> had been charged with “lewd and lascivious conduct on a child under 14” in 1982, but four months later, prosecutors agreed to drop the charge in a plea deal in exchange for <span id="mention-24" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s pleading guilty to grand theft.</p>

<p><span id="mention-25" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>, according to <span id="mention-83" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>'s latest motion, lied when questioned by <span id="mention-84" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s defense attorney, saying he had never faced charges of physical violence. In <span id="mention-119" class="mention place" about="Florida">Florida</span>, the “lewd and lascivious assault on a child under 14” is considered physical violence.</p>

<p>"The State knew, at the time of Mr. <span id="mention-85" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>’s trial, that <span id="mention-26" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span> had perjured himself before the jury. Mr. <span id="mention-176" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> was apparently prepared to ask <span id="mention-124" class="mention person" about="JohnHalliday">Halliday</span> about <span id="mention-27" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s prior sexual assault charge, but, after <span id="mention-28" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s false testimony regarding his criminal history, Mr. <span id="mention-177" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> did not. The State permitted <span id="mention-29" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s false testimony about his criminal history to stand uncorrected," according to this motion.</p>

<blockquote>'8 overturned convictions in 2019 had a jailhouse informant involved, according to the <span id="mention-201" class="mention organization" about="NationalRegistryofExonerations">National Registry of Exonerations</span>.'</blockquote>

<p>The 1987 trial transcripts do not indicate that the prosecutors corrected the record or entered a stipulation for the jury to consider that charge on <span id="mention-30" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>'s criminal history during deliberations.</p>

<p>"We knew he'd had -- a history of a sexual assault allegation," <span id="mention-178" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> said to <span id="mention-195" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span>. <span id="mention-179" class="mention person" about="RobertHeyman">Heyman</span> later acknowledged to <span id="mention-196" class="mention organization" about="ABCNews">ABC News</span> that he never mentioned <span id="mention-31" class="mention person" about="PaulSkalnik">Skalnik</span>’s sexual assault charge to the jurors, saying that it would only have been his responsibility to alert the jury had there been a conviction for sexual assault.</p>

<p>At a court hearing on on Feb. 20, Circuit Judge <span id="mention-255" class="mention person" about="PatSiracusa" data-label="Pat Siracusa">Pat Siracusa</span> granted the defense’s request for an evidentiary hearing at which <span id="mention-112" class="mention person" about="JackPearcy">Pearcy</span> will be called to testify. That hearing is scheduled for March 5.</p>

<p>A new execution date has not been set for <span id="mention-86" class="mention person" about="JamesDailey">Dailey</span>.</p>
