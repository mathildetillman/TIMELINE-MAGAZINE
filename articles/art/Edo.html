          were still appointed by the emperor. While the emperor and his court
          held all the prestige, it was the shogun who held the power and
          effectively ruled the country. The title of shogun was practically
          hereditary and, during the Edo Period, it remained within the Tokugawa
          family. A shogun ruled with the help of officials known as bakufu
          (幕府, “tent government”).

          Tokugawa family, they were responsible for local government in their
          domains. Initially, the

        <h2>Samurai</h2>
        <p>
          Samurai were the soldiers, some of them reporting directly to the
          shogun, others kept as retainers by daimyos. Samurais didn't own the
          land and didn't work, for it would be beneath them. Combat was their
          only occupation, but in a period as peaceful as the Edo Period, there
          wasn't that much fighting to do, so many samurai also devoted their
          time to arts. It was common for samurai to be well educated and enjoy
          many social privileges. Shortly after the Edo Period, their role
          became obsolete, as it was much cheaper to have conscript soldiers
          that we know from the modern armies. But they utilized the experience
          gained during the Edo Period in managing daimyo estates and many of
          them moved into business and professional roles.

        <h2>Sankin-kōtai</h2>
        <p>
          Sankin-kōtai was a policy that helped shoguns keep their friends close
          and enemies closer. It mandated the daimyos to spend every other year
          in
          <span class="mention place" about="Edo" data-label="Edo"> Edo</span>
          (today's
          <span class="mention place" about="Tokyo" data-label="Tokyo">

          >), and also, their families had to permanently live in
          <span class="mention place" about="Edo" data-label="Edo"> Edo</span>.
          It allowed for easier connection to the central power but was also a
          subtle form of holding hostages in case the daimyos had any ideas
          about uprising. For the shogunate, it had the added benefit of
          draining daimyos' financial resources by maintaining two lavish
          residences; this further assured they would not wage war.

          <span class="mention place" about="Japan" data-label="Japan">
            Japan</span
          >. From the 1630s, foreigners were not allowed to step on Japanese
          land, and breaking this rule was punishable by death on the spot.
          Also, any Japanese wanting to leave the country were not allowed to
          come back. At certain times during the Edo Period, shipbuilding was
          banned. It does not mean that there was no foreign trade, however.

        <h2>Hankō and Terakoya</h2>
        <p>
          I already mentioned that samurai were well educated. In general, the
          population of Japan during the Edo Period was relatively well
          educated, especially in the higher echelons. Hankō or han schools were
          established to educate the children of daimyos and samurai in the
          local feudal domains. Those were state schools and, initially, the
          curriculum focused on Confucian studies. With time, however, access to
          schools was broadened beyond the daimyo and samurai, and the
          curriculum was significantly extended to cover training in classical
          <span class="mention place" about="Japan" data-label="Japan">

          >ese studies, medicine, and the various branches of Western learning
          including mathematics, astronomy, military science, and ballistics.

          Terakoya were different from hankō in that they were private schools
          aimed at the common classes, mostly merchants, who had the money but
          were quite low standing in
          <span class="mention concept" about="society" data-label="Society">
            society</span
          >. Initially, the schools were often existing within the Buddhist
          temples, but later they also often found space in private homes of the
          upper classes. The curriculum began with calligraphy courses and then
          grew to include counting with the abacus, history, and geography. They
          taught about the daily lives of people, household precepts,
          conversation skills, and moral values, as well as historical and
          geographical topics, which showed a wider scope of social life to the
          students.

            culture</span

          . The subject matter ranged from female beauties; kabuki actors and
          sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and
          landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica or scenes of gore. Hishikawa
          Moronobu was one of the first representatives of this style in its
          mature form. His prints were monochrome or colored by hand. But color
          printing soon followed. By the 18th century, we can admire the works
          of such titans as

          With a period so culturally rich as Edo, it is difficult to summarize
          it in a few paragraphs, but hopefully the above gave you a quick
          glimpse into that time. And whet your appetite to explore more about
          this fascinating time when
          <span class="mention place" about="Japan" data-label="Japan">
            Japan</span
          >
          closed its borders to outsiders and flourished within itself. The art
          they created was so deeply influential that it heavily impacted
          artists in the West.
