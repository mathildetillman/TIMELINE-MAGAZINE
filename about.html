              TIMELINE MAGAZINE is a project realized for the examination of the course of Information modelling and web technologies held by Fabio Vitali within the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna.

              The purpose of this magazine is to give a sophisticated audience a system that organizes content into 
              publications that are nicely presented and with the possibility of swiching typographic themes while giving
              the user a supply of metadata in the articles.
            </p>

              The different styles of TIMELINE MAGAZINE is old history (1500s - 1800s), which captures the textures and feels of old print along with black and white images. 
              Another important period of deisgn is the early 20th century, esoecially the Bauhaus movement. Filled with new modern uses of typefaces and grpahical elements it drew inspiration from arts and craft movements and mixed it with modernism to create the style we all know so well.
              The last two grpahical styles takes us back to the good old 2000s,  where popculture peaked with large imagery, bright colors and fun layouts, and 2030, where we explore what design within print and web will look like and how todays trends will evolve in the future.
