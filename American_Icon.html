        <h2>Early Paintings</h2>
        <p>
          One of the many highlights of this retrospective is the reunion of
          works across the numerous series produced over the course of several
          decades. The exhibition opens with an early series of paintings that
          confront the racial tensions of the 1960s that are emotionally driven
          and skillfully capture the subtle yet commonplace hostilities of this
          nation where the imbalance of power was and continues to be skewed in
          favor of one race.
        </p>

        <p>
          The showdown between white supremacy and black power is quietly
          addressed in some paintings from the American People Series, for
          example in Hide Little Children. In other paintings from this series,
          the confrontation is amplified as in The Flag is Bleeding and U.S.
          Postage Stamp Commemorating the Advent of Black Power but reaches an
          absolute boiling point in Die.
        </p>

        <p>
          These three mural paintings reveal the systemic racism eating away at
          a democracy that was never pure through the clever incorporation of
          racial slurs and terms of empowerment with patriotic symbols such as
          the U.S. flag and the U.S. postal stamp. The vision of chaos, the race
          riot in Die captures the turbulence of the 1960s, however, the
          intensity of this scene and those of all the paintings from the
          American People Series continue to resonate given that the uneven
          distribution of power and opportunity continues to plague this nation.

        <p>
          The recurrence of the U.S. flag throughout this period explores the
          hypocrisy of this iconic image and the parallel narratives running
          through this patriotic arrangement of stars and stripes but also gives
          insight into
          <span

            data-label="Faith Ringgold"

          >'s masterful use of language and image as form.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is further evident in an eye-catching pattern devised by the
          artist that divides square and rectangular picture planes into eight
          triangles. Filled with either bold text or images, these triangles
          move rhythmically around the picture plane in a manner that was
          intended to break away from the Minimalist grid. Borrowed from an
          African Bakuba design,

          >'s imagination takes off with the introduction of textiles for
          numerous series of soft sculpture masks and story quilt paintings.
          Made in collaboration with her mother Willie Posey, a couture fashion
          designer who taught
          <span
            class="mention person"
            about="FaithRinggold"

          to sew, these works are powerful patchworks of personal biography and
          historical events.
        </p>

        <p>
          The collaboration between daughter and mother began with the Feminist
          Series and Slave Rape paintings that were in part response to Tibetan
          tanka (thangkas) paintings, a sacred and portable art form of
          paintings on fabric that could be rolled up. Drawn to this rich
          tradition,
          <span
            class="mention person"
            about="FaithRinggold"
            data-label="Faith Ringgold"
            >Ringgold</span
          >
          was also attracted to the idea of paintings on fabric that were easy
          and inexpensive to install and transport. The move towards the fabric
          arts and that which has been categorized as women's work not only gave
          her the professional independence to show her work frequently and
          without limitations but expanded her potential and created more
          opportunities for the artist to delve deeper into her practice of
          storytelling as well as branch out with performances.

          Mining the history of her own family which includes ancestors not too
          many generations ago who were born into slavery, particularly on her
          mother's side,

          is dealing directly with generational trauma brought on by personal
          and collective proximity to slavery and its aftermath that lead right
          up to her own lifetime. Through this historical lens, the artist works
          through interpersonal relationships, the hardships between lovers, the
          complicated dynamics between mothers and daughters, and also looks
          inward reimagining herself and the experiences of her ancestors.

          >'s Over 100 Pound Weight Loss Performance Story Quilt series of the
          late 1980s documents the artist using her body for these objects and
          performances at a time when other women artists had also moved into
          the realm of Body Art. The large quilt, used for this series and
          others, gives equal importance to the text as much as to the images.
          Photographic images were used for this series, however, paintings
          appear on most of the other series of story quilts. The text in the
          Change series goes into the details of her weight loss journey while
          the text that appears on other story quilts imagines conversations and
          explores narratives that freely mix together fantasy with reality.

          The three-dimensional fabric pieces, the soft sculptures, also used
          for past performances, carry forth the artist's concerns and
          interests. These soft sculpture installations at the New Museum are a
          selection of quietly intense tableaux that grab the viewer's
          attention. The museum label for The Wake and Resurrection of the

          The amount of text incorporated into the story quilts makes for a lot
          of reading and one can only wish for transcripts of the complete text
          because there is a lot to read at the New Museum. Not so much a
          complaint but a longing to sit down and savor the text so carefully
          chosen for each story quilt. It is easy to feel swept away by the many
          stories marching across beautifully crafted quilts that are standalone
          masterpieces.

          school library because they are rich with historical information that
          has failed to make its way into the general curricula of the American
          school system, one that continues to cram all of Black history into
          one month. Black history is American history, a concept that has yet
          to permeate the American school system and a collective understanding
          of the nation's history.

          installation of The French Collection, an exquisite series of 12 story

          The French Collection features cameo appearances from some of the most
          iconic figures and paintings of the western art canon, especially
          those from around the turn of the 20th century, to re-envision spaces
          occupied by the main character and other black artists and
          intellectuals that reimagines art history.

        <p>
          The choice of subjects is partially historically accurate but the
          artist does not limit herself and takes advantage of creative license
          to include historical figures from other times and places as well as
          her own ancestors in a way that disregards a logical timeline. This
          series beautifully stitches together imagined conversations and
          situations that turn the art history canon inside out with this series
          of colorful and wildly exciting story quilts. This gallery deserves a
          standing ovation.
