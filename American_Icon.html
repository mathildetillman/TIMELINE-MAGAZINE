        <p>
          Faith Ringgold is an artist, educator, storyteller, activist, mother,
          and the subject of a major retrospective at the New Museum in New York
          City. Ringgold is also an American treasure whose artistic journey has
          followed her own truths, many of which are interwoven into the
          uncomfortable history of the nation. Faith Ringgold: American People
          is a comprehensive and pleasing overview of Ringgold's career
          encompassing five decades of work and reaffirmation of her legendary
          status in the grand scheme of art history. Unconventional and
          unapologetically outspoken, this exhibition celebrates Ringgold's
          masterful use of image, text, and fabric to explore the nuances of the
          human condition.
        </p>

        <h2>Faith Ringgold: American People</h2>

        <p>
          The highly anticipated exhibition Faith Ringgold: American People
          fills three floors of the New Museum with paintings, story quilts,
          soft sculptures, political posters, and ephemera that define this
          artist's career while also paying special tribute to her
          accomplishments as an author of children's books.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born in 1930, Faith Ringgold was an art student at City College in New
          York where she earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art,
          married her first husband, and became the mother to two daughters,
          Michele and Barbara, in the 1950s. She worked for almost two decades
          as an art teacher in the New York public school system and secured her
          first solo exhibition in 1967 at the Spectrum Gallery in midtown
          Manhattan.

        <p>
          In the interim, she married her second husband, Burdett Ringgold, and
          became an active participant in the Civil Rights and Feminist Art
          Movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s. She was co-founder of
          several groups including the Art Workers' Coalition (AWC), Where We
          At, and Women Students and Artists for Black Art Liberation (WSABAL).
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, Ringgold was a member of the Ad Hoc Women Artists'
          Committee and led protests against the underrepresentation of women
          and Black artists at art institutions such as the Whitney Museum of
          American Art and the Museum of Modern Art. The New Museum has devoted
          a gallery space to this period of activism with correspondence,
          posters, photographs - some showing Ringgold with her teenage
          daughters at various protests - and other materials related to The
          People's Flag Show, co-organized with Jean Toche and Jon Hendricks in
          1970 at the Judson Memorial Church in New York. Soon after this
          exhibition opened, Ringgold, Toche, and Hendricks, also known as the
          “Judson Three,” were arrested and convicted of using the American flag
          in an uncomplimentary manner, for which the charges were eventually
          dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Black woman artist at the intersection of two groundbreaking
          political movements, Ringgold was acutely aware that her particular
          concerns and conditions were not being adequately addressed by her
          white female and Black male counterparts. However, her involvement
          with and founding of different groups with slightly different agendas
          created opportunities for Ringgold to speak out across multiple
          platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, access to her peers was not always a guarantee. Ringgold was
          denied membership to the Spiral group, of which Emma Amos was the only
          female artist invited to join this reputable group of Black male
          artists. Regardless, Ringgold's career continued to progress in and
          around the mainstream art world, for the artist was unafraid to speak
          out publicly and take risks in the studio. Ringgold's integration of
          sewn fabrics and quilting practices combined with her fearless choice
          of subject matter and embrace of non-western artistic traditions
          created possibilities for the artist to determine her own path.

        <h2>Early Paintings</h2>
        <p>
          One of the many highlights of this retrospective is the reunion of
          works across the numerous series produced over the course of several
          decades. The exhibition opens with an early series of paintings that
          confront the racial tensions of the 1960s that are emotionally driven
          and skillfully capture the subtle yet commonplace hostilities of this
          nation where the imbalance of power was and continues to be skewed in
          favor of one race.
        </p>

        <p>
          The showdown between white supremacy and black power is quietly
          addressed in some paintings from the American People Series, for
          example in Hide Little Children. In other paintings from this series,
          the confrontation is amplified as in The Flag is Bleeding and U.S.
          Postage Stamp Commemorating the Advent of Black Power but reaches an
          absolute boiling point in Die.
        </p>

        <p>
          These three mural paintings reveal the systemic racism eating away at
          a democracy that was never pure through the clever incorporation of
          racial slurs and terms of empowerment with patriotic symbols such as
          the U.S. flag and the U.S. postal stamp. The vision of chaos, the race
          riot in Die captures the turbulence of the 1960s, however, the
          intensity of this scene and those of all the paintings from the
          American People Series continue to resonate given that the uneven
          distribution of power and opportunity continues to plague this nation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The recurrence of the U.S. flag throughout this period explores the
          hypocrisy of this iconic image and the parallel narratives running
          through this patriotic arrangement of stars and stripes but also gives
          insight into Ringgold's masterful use of language and image as form.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is further evident in an eye-catching pattern devised by the
          artist that divides square and rectangular picture planes into eight
          triangles. Filled with either bold text or images, these triangles
          move rhythmically around the picture plane in a manner that was
          intended to break away from the Minimalist grid. Borrowed from an
          African Bakuba design, Ringgold's interpretation was employed to
          generate messages of power, and in some cases of self, for both
          paintings and posters.

        <h2>Story Quilts and Soft Sculptures</h2>

        <p>
          As a devoted educator and compelling storyteller, Ringgold's
          imagination takes off with the introduction of textiles for numerous
          series of soft sculpture masks and story quilt paintings. Made in
          collaboration with her mother Willie Posey, a couture fashion designer
          who taught Ringgold to sew, these works are powerful patchworks of
          personal biography and historical events.
        </p>

        <p>
          The collaboration between daughter and mother began with the Feminist
          Series and Slave Rape paintings that were in part response to Tibetan
          tanka (thangkas) paintings, a sacred and portable art form of
          paintings on fabric that could be rolled up. Drawn to this rich
          tradition, Ringgold was also attracted to the idea of paintings on
          fabric that were easy and inexpensive to install and transport. The
          move towards the fabric arts and that which has been categorized as
          women's work not only gave her the professional independence to show
          her work frequently and without limitations but expanded her potential
          and created more opportunities for the artist to delve deeper into her
          practice of storytelling as well as branch out with performances.

        <p>
          Mining the history of her own family which includes ancestors not too
          many generations ago who were born into slavery, particularly on her
          mother's side, Ringgold is dealing directly with generational trauma
          brought on by personal and collective proximity to slavery and its
          aftermath that lead right up to her own lifetime. Through this
          historical lens, the artist works through interpersonal relationships,
          the hardships between lovers, the complicated dynamics between mothers
          and daughters, and also looks inward reimagining herself and the
          experiences of her ancestors.

        <p>
          The Change: Faith Ringgold's Over 100 Pound Weight Loss Performance
          Story Quilt series of the late 1980s documents the artist using her
          body for these objects and performances at a time when other women
          artists had also moved into the realm of Body Art. The large quilt,
          used for this series and others, gives equal importance to the text as
          much as to the images. Photographic images were used for this series,
          however, paintings appear on most of the other series of story quilts.
          The text in the Change series goes into the details of her weight loss
          journey while the text that appears on other story quilts imagines
          conversations and explores narratives that freely mix together fantasy
          with reality.

          The three-dimensional fabric pieces, the soft sculptures, also used
          for past performances, carry forth the artist's concerns and
          interests. These soft sculpture installations at the New Museum are a
          selection of quietly intense tableaux that grab the viewer's
          attention. The museum label for The Wake and Resurrection of the
          Bicentennial Negro, explains the following:
        </p>

        <q
          >"Ringgold draws on masquerade traditions from the Dan people of
          modern-day Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire that make use of sculpture,
          costume, music, dance, and drama as a catalyst tor the critique of the
          American Bicentennial, which was celebrated with enormous pageantry in
          1976. For Ringgold, the anniversary of independence was not a moment
          for celebration, but rather one for great mourning. As Ringgold has
          said, ‘for almost half of that time we had been in slavery, and for
          most of the following years we had still been struggling to become
          fully free."</q

        </p>

        <p>
          The amount of text incorporated into the story quilts makes for a lot
          of reading and one can only wish for transcripts of the complete text
          because there is a lot to read at the New Museum. Not so much a
          complaint but a longing to sit down and savor the text so carefully
          chosen for each story quilt. It is easy to feel swept away by the many
          stories marching across beautifully crafted quilts that are standalone
          masterpieces.
        </p>

        <p>
          The public was given the opportunity to read one of these stories in
          book format when Ringgold published her first children's book, Tar
          Beach in 1991. Based on her Woman on a Bridge series of story quilts
          from the mid to late 1980s, Ringgold has since authored 17 children's
          books in addition to a memoir We Flew Over the Bridge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ringgold's children's books are classics that should be in every
          elementary school library because they are rich with historical
          information that has failed to make its way into the general curricula
          of the American school system, one that continues to cram all of Black
          history into one month. Black history is American history, a concept
          that has yet to permeate the American school system and a collective
          understanding of the nation's history.

          The New Museum committed an entire floor to a breathtaking
          installation of The French Collection, an exquisite series of 12 story
          quilts that were also the subject of a 1988 exhibition at the New
          Museum, Dancing at the Louvre: Faith Ringgold's French Collection and
          Other Story Quilts. Visually stunning, the artist used this body of
          work to travel abroad and back in time to the 1920s.
        </p>

        <p>
          The central character of this story, Willie Marie Simone, a
          combination of the artist and the artist's mother, moves to Paris,
          marries a white man, has two children, and becomes a widow within a
          short time span. Following the death of her husband, Willie Marie is
          left with the financial resources to support herself comfortably and
          pursue an art career. Choosing to send her two children back to the
          U.S. to be raised by her aunt, Willie Marie has the complete freedom
          to take part in the Parisian art scene of the 1920s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout this series, Ringgold generously references the presence of
          Black American expatriates who were actually in Paris around that time
          and who took refuge in the relaxed attitudes of the French towards
          African Americans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every painting is accompanied by text that is based on a series of
          letters between Willie Maria and her aunt that give insight into
          Willie Marie's time in France, her experiences of being a Black woman
          artist, and her decision to not raise her children. In response to her
          aunt's question about her choice to become an artist, Willie Marie
          states the following:
        </p>

        <q
          >"My art is my freedom to say what I please. N'importe what color you
          are, you can do what you want aves ton art. They may not like it, or
          buy it, or even let you show it; but they can't stop you from doing
          it."</q

          The French Collection features cameo appearances from some of the most
          iconic figures and paintings of the western art canon, especially
          those from around the turn of the 20th century, to re-envision spaces
          occupied by the main character and other black artists and
          intellectuals that reimagines art history.
        </p>

        <p>
          The choice of subjects is partially historically accurate but the
          artist does not limit herself and takes advantage of creative license
          to include historical figures from other times and places as well as
          her own ancestors in a way that disregards a logical timeline. This
          series beautifully stitches together imagined conversations and
          situations that turn the art history canon inside out with this series
          of colorful and wildly exciting story quilts. This gallery deserves a
          standing ovation.

          Ringgold's daughter Michele Wallace has frequently written about her
          mother's art, including an essay for this exhibition's catalog, and
          provided her mother feedback while she was in the process of
          developing the stories for her quilts. Despite the close personal and
          professional relationship between mother and daughter, Wallace is
          unable to explain Ringgold's curious decision to realize the female
          protagonist of The French Collection, Willie Marie, and Marlena, the
          fictional daughter of Willie Marie and the central character of the
          next series The American Collection, as women whose life choices
          regarding their careers and motherhood do not reflect those of
          Ringgold. Across these two series of story quilts, Ringgold explores
          feelings of guilt, regret, and forgiveness as they impact the
          mother/child relationship. Marlena forgives her mother but vows to
          become a successful artist and devoted mother.

          The American Collection, a series of 11 quilts, traces Marlena's
          journey and her professional achievements yet she remains alone
          without a life partner or children. Her story takes place in the
          United States where Ringgold resumes her ongoing conversation with the
          past, particularly with the history of slavery.

          Faith Ringgold: American People at the New Museum is a deep dive into
          Faith Ringgold's distinguished and critically acclaimed career, one
          that should be familiar to most Americans. This highly anticipated
          exhibition does not disappoint and will easily go down as one of, if
          not, the best show of the year.

          Faith Ringgold: American People is open to the public through June 5,
          2022.
