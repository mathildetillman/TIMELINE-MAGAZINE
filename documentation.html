              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>
                Before the 15th century, creating books was a meticulous and time-consuming process that had to be done by hand. But in 1450, the printing press was invented and the process was automated. The layout in the classical period was typically to order the text in one justified column per page. The text was placed to create harmony on the spread; larger margins on the bottom than on the top, and larger outer margins than inner. The designers paid attention to the relative relationships between the page elements and based the relationships on geometry and aesthetic rules. One especially important principle is the golden ratio, which is a method that artists can use to create an aesthetically pleasing division of space, as well as establish a hierarchy between elements. The proportions between the elements of our design were therefore based on the golden number, φ, which is approximately equal to 1.6.

              <h3>Typography</h3>
              <p>
                The people of the Renaissance wanted to revive the classical culture. They were on the quest to find ancient lower case letters that could match the inscription capitals from the Roman, and the roman type was developed.

              <h2 id="early-20th">Early 20th Century</h2>
              <p>
                In the early 20th century the German school of art - Bauhaus,  originated . This later turned into the art movement we now know by the unique approach towards architecture and graphic design. Bauhaus earned its name from the aesthetic of combining both fine art, with crafts and influencing modern and contemporary art. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The characterization of Bauhaus is most known for its emphasis on function and balance, thus typical bauhas designs, whether architectural, print or paintings used a lot of balanced forms and abstracts shapes.

              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>
                In the Bauhaus period, a lot of innovative approaches was being used towards creating layouts and prints. Designers played with the placement of objects in experimental ways, using angles and whitespaces, as well as typography as the hero of the design.
              </p>
              <p>The use of simple geometric shapes was also an essential part of the Bauhasu design movement. The use of these shapes in designs showed the special connection between the layers of visual communications and how these shapes and colors could convey feelings and messages in the designs </p>

              <h3>Typography</h3>
              <p>
                During this period fonts and typefaces was now taken more seriously in the way that they function in designs, as an essantial part of the beutiful and visual communication. Considered as the main communication medium, typography had to be emphasized and in 1952 It was commisioned to create the idealistic typeface that displayed the simplicity and emphatic form of Bauhas. This resulted in a simple geometric sans-serif type. In this period of time serif fonts was thought to be unnecessary
              </p>
              <p>
                All other typefaces used in this period of time followed the same rulings and took inspirations in this “universial” typeface.

                Primary colors, red, yellow, blue, black and white, as well as combinations of these, was the most used in designs during this time. This comes back to the simplicity of the design movement while still creating colorful and vibrant deigns with function and value

              <p>
                The design choices for the 2000’s style are based on the teen magazine CosmoGirl. CosmoGirl was an American teen magazine aimed at girls that were published from 1999 - 2008. It mainly featured celebrity interviews, and beauty and fashion sections.
              </p>

              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>The layout of the pages features large images with text written on top. The text often takes a secondary role, only filling up half of the page. The text is organized into three columns per page and is usually situated near the bottom. Margins between the columns are smaller than on the outside, and the outer margins are equal.</p>
              
              <h3>Typography</h3>
              <p>
                Titles of the magazine and various articles are superimposed on top of the image. The text is presented in a mix of typographic styles, colors, and letter casing. For the articles, the titles were frequently colored and in lower case. The font used for the Cosmopolitan logo is Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed, which is not available for free. But the Franklin Gothic ATF Bold is almost identical and was therefore chosen as the font for the titles. Bold type is used for questions in the interviews and italic type for emphasis and descriptions. Quotes are presented in bigger font sizes and in colors matching the image and title colors.
              </p>

              <h3>Colors</h3>
              <p>
                The color palette used is young and vibrant. The covers of the magazines consisted of a cut-out image of a celebrity, where the background has been filled in with a bright color.

              <p>
                A lot of design trends during the last year gives us a great many pointers towards how design will look and be used in the years following. Based on current trends it is
predicted that the future of design will be something called creative pragmatism. Bold and expressive, yet intentional design will fill both screens and prints. Creative pragmatism is the mix of creativity, which leans on the imagination, boldness and expressive styles, and pragmatism that means being realistic and practical rather than theoretical.
              </p>
              <h3>Layout</h3>
              <p>
                Moderns sites will be opting for asymmetric styles in the future using css grid and broken grid systems. This allows designers to construct layouts of more complicated looks. 
              </p>
              <p>
                A long with this another thing that will see its rise in the years to come is abstract and geometric backgrounds and patterns. These versatile and expressive patterns can be used on almost everything to give a more unique and interesting look on what can be pretty boring designs in the first place

              <h3>Typography</h3>
              <p>
                Looking towards the trends of today, we see alot of design work no longer taking the 1 typeface approach, but moving towards a more brutalistic way of seeing typography. Looking at this design in the future is likely to follow this even more and use a lot of striking but dissimilar typefaces to help with catching the eye of the viewer and revolutionize the world of typeography as we know it today. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Another perspective of typeogrpahy in the future is that it will be so many different but not so dissimilar typefaces that will cause designer to go out of their way when deisgning and using typefaces. THis will in turn lead to some very outgoing and unusual styled typefaces that will end up in both print and web design. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Serif fonts are gainging their popularity when talking about experimental typogrpahy designs.

              <h3>Colors</h3>
              <p>For the future of design in this creative pragmatism color will also follow along with having a lot of expressive colors and hard contrasts. Using a vast range of colors with a lot of oppositioning colors will melt together and create eye catching looks. This means using complimentary colors in high contrats, neon or high saturations. </p>
